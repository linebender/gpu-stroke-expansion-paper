abstract = {Vector graphics formats offer support for both filled and stroked primitives. Filled primitives paint all points in the region bounded by a set of outlines. Stroked primitives paint all points covered by a line drawn over the outlines. Editors allow users to convert stroked primitives to the outlines of equivalent filled primitives for further editing. Likewise, renderers typically convert stroked primitives to equivalent filled primitives prior to rendering. This conversion problem is deceivingly difficult to solve. Surprisingly, it has received little to no attention in the literature. Existing implementations output too many segments, do not satisfy accuracy requirements, or fail under a variety of conditions, often spectacularly. In this paper, we present a solution to the stroke-to-fill conversion problem that addresses these issues. One of our key insights is to take into account the evolutes of input outlines, in addition to their offsets, in regions of high curvature. Furthermore, our approach strives to maintain continuity between the input and the set of painted points. Our implementation is available in open source.},

abstract = {Stroking and filling are the two basic rendering operations on paths in vector graphics. The theory of filling a path is well-understood in terms of contour integrals and winding numbers, but when path rendering standards specify stroking, they resort to the analogy of painting pixels with a brush that traces the outline of the path. This means important standards such as PDF, SVG, and PostScript lack a rigorous way to say what samples are inside or outside a stroked path. Our work fills this gap with a principled theory of stroking.Guided by our theory, we develop a novel polar stroking method to render stroked paths robustly with an intuitive way to bound the tessellation error without needing recursion. Because polar stroking guarantees small uniform steps in tangent angle, it provides an efficient way to accumulate arc length along a path for texturing or dashing. While this paper focuses on developing the theory of our polar stroking method, we have successfully implemented our methods on modern programmable GPUs.},

abstract = {We identify a class of root-searching methods that surprisingly outperform the bisection method on the average performance while retaining minmax optimality. The improvement on the average applies for any continuous distributional hypothesis. We also pinpoint one specific method within the class and show that under mild initial conditions it can attain an order of convergence of up to 1.618, i.e., the same as the secant method. Hence, we attain both an improved average performance and an improved order of convergence with no cost on the minmax optimality of the bisection method. Numerical experiments show that, on regular functions, the proposed method requires a number of function evaluations similar to current state-of-the-art methods, about 24\% to 37\% of the evaluations required by the bisection procedure. In problems with non-regular functions, the proposed method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art, requiring on average 82\% of the total evaluations required for the bisection method, while the other methods were outperformed by bisection. In the worst case, while current state-of-the-art commercial solvers required two to three times the number of function evaluations of bisection, our proposed method remained within the minmax bounds of the bisection method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we implement an efficient, completely software-based graphics pipeline on a GPU. Unlike previous approaches, we obey ordering constraints imposed by current graphics APIs, guarantee hole-free rasterization, and support multisample antialiasing. Our goal is to examine the performance implications of not exploiting the fixed-function graphics pipeline, and to discern which additional hardware support would benefit software-based graphics the most. We present significant improvements over previous work in terms of scalability, performance, and capabilities. Our pipeline is malleable and easy to extend, and we demonstrate that in a wide variety of test cases its performance is within a factor of 2--8x compared to the hardware graphics pipeline on a top of the line GPU. Our implementation is open sourced and available at http://code.google.com/p/cudaraster/},

  abstract = {We present a massively parallel vector graphics rendering pipeline that is divided into two components. The preprocessing component builds a novel adaptive acceleration data structure, the shortcut tree. Tree construction is efficient and parallel at the segment level, enabling dynamic vector graphics. The tree allows efficient random access to the color of individual samples, so the graphics can be warped for special effects. The rendering component processes all samples and pixels in parallel. It was optimized for wide antialiasing filters and a large number of samples per pixel to generate sharp, noise-free images. Our sample scheduler allows pixels with overlapping antialiasing filters to share samples. It groups together samples that can be computed with the same vector operations using little memory or bandwidth. The pipeline is feature-rich, supporting multiple layers of filled paths, each defined by curved outlines (with linear, rational quadratic, and integral cubic Bézier segments), clipped against other paths, and painted with semi-transparent colors, gradients, or textures. We demonstrate renderings of complex vector graphics in state-of-the-art quality and performance. Finally, we provide full source-code for our implementation as well as the input data used in the paper.},
