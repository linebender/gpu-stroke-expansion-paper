# GPU-friendly stroke expansion paper

This repo is for open collaboration on a research paper on GPU path rendering. It is intended to cover the work on [Vello], particularly the GPU stroke expansion algorithms based on Euler spirals.

The repo contains the TeX sources, bibliography, and figures. As we work, it will also contain scripts to run benchmarks, test data, and related support. The renderer itself will remain in its own repository, however. Any code is covered under the [Apache 2 license](LICENSE). The text is covered under the [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

We expect to submit the paper to a prestigious academic conference. Suggestions and comments are welcome through the repo's issue tracker. We are also open to more active collaboration.

Contributions are welcome under the same terms as other [Linebender] projects. The [Rust code of conduct] applies.
